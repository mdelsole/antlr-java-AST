# antlr-java-AST
Implementation of a custom programming language in antlr + java using abstract syntax trees

## About:
In this project we use a java-based "visitor pattern" (visitor for short) to traverse the abstract syntax tree generated by our ANTLR grammar.

## Running:
1. Generate the proper java files from ANTLR grammar. Run the following command with the ```-visitor``` flag, to generate a visitor in addition to the rest of the files:
```
antlr4 pascal.g4 -visitor
```
2. Compile generated java files:
```
javac pascal*.java
```
